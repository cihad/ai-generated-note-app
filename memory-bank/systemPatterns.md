# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a modern React application architecture with TypeScript, focusing on:

- Component-based architecture
- Type-safe development
- Clean code organization
- Modern state management
- Responsive design patterns

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Component Structure**

   - Functional components with hooks
   - TypeScript interfaces for props
   - Modular component design
   - Reusable UI components

2. **State Management**

   - React hooks for local state
   - Context API for global state
   - Efficient state updates
   - Type-safe state handling

3. **Styling Approach**

   - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
   - Responsive design patterns
   - Component-specific styles
   - Theme consistency

4. **Code Organization**
   - Feature-based folder structure
   - Shared components library
   - Type definitions
   - Utility functions

## Design Patterns in Use

- **Component Pattern**: Reusable UI components
- **Hook Pattern**: Custom hooks for shared logic
- **Context Pattern**: Global state management
- **Container/Presenter**: Separation of concerns
- **Factory Pattern**: Component creation

## Component Relationships

- Parent-child component hierarchy
- Shared component library
- Context providers and consumers
- Hook-based state sharing
- Event handling patterns

## Data Flow

1. User interactions
2. State updates
3. UI re-renders
4. Data persistence
5. Real-time updates
